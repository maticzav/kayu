Kayu is a TypeScript code generator and a lightweight GraphQL client. It lets you create queries using TypeScirpt, and guarantees that every query you create is valid.

The library revolves around three core principles:

1. If your project compiles, your queries work;
1. Abstract as much GraphQL away from the developer;
1. Laverage TypeScript compiler as much as possible.

I have created it because there seemed to be a gap in existing clients - you could either send raw queries as strings or use full blown clients with caching and whatnot. On the other hand, you'd need to read lots of documentation unrelated to your project to get TypeScript's type-checker to work.

This library aims to merge that gap and simplify overall workflow.
